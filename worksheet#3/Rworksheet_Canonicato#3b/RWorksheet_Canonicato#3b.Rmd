                  #Worksheet-3b in R



#1. Create a data frame using the table below.

#a. Write the codes. 

respondents <- c(1:20)
sex <- c(2,2,1,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,1,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,1,2)
fathers_occupation <- c(1,3,3,3,1,2,3,1,1,1,3,2,1,3,3,1,3,1,2,1)
persons_at_home <- c(5,7,3,8,5,9,6,7,8,4,7,5,4,7,8,8,3,11,7,6)
siblings_at_school <- c(6,4,4,1,2,1,5,3,1,2,3,2,5,5,2,1,2,5,3,2)
types_of_houses <- c(1,2,3,1,1,3,3,1,2,3,2,3,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,2)

Household_Data <- data.frame(respondents,sex,fathers_occupation,persons_at_home,siblings_at_school,types_of_houses)
Household_Data


#b. Describe the data. Get the structure or the summary of the data 

str(Household_Data)
summary(Household_Data)


#c. Is the mean number of siblings attending is 5?

siblings_mean <- mean(siblings_at_school)
siblings_mean

# the mean number of siblings attending school is not 5 but 2.95 

#d. Extract the 1st two rows and then all the columns using the subsetting functions. Write the codes and its output.

firstTwo_rows <- head(Household_Data, 2)
firstTwo_rows

#Output: 
#     respondents sex fathers_occupation persons_at_home siblings_at_school
#          1      2               1               5                  6
#          2      2               3               7                  4
#   types_of_houses
#               1
#               2

#e. Extract 3rd and 5th row with 2nd and 4th column. Write the codes and its result.
extract_rows_column <- Household_Data[c(3,5),c(2,4)]
extract_rows_column

#f. Select the variable types of houses then store the vector that results as types_houses. Write the codes.

types_houses <- Household_Data$types_of_houses
types_houses

#g. Select only all Males respondent that their father occupation was farmer. Write the codes and its output.

male_farmer= Household_Data[Household_Data$sex == 1 & Household_Data$fathers_occupation == 1,]
male_farmer

#h.Select only all females respondent that have greater than or equal to 5 number of siblings attending school. Write the codes and its outputs.

females_siblings_school <- Household_Data[Household_Data$siblings_at_school >= 5,]
females_siblings_school



#2.Write a R program to create an empty data frame. Using the following codes: 

df = data.frame(Ints=integer(),
                Doubles=double(), 
                Characters=character(),
                Logicals=logical(),
                Factors=factor(),
                stringsAsFactors=FALSE)

print("Structure of the empty dataframe:")
print(str(df))

#a. Describe the results.
#This output shows that the dataframe `df` has 0 observations (rows) and 6 variables (columns). The variable types are `integer`, `double`, `character`, `logical`, `factor`, and `factor` with 0 levels.
#Since the dataframe is empty, all the variables are also empty. This means that the `Ints`, `Doubles`, `Characters`, `Logicals`, and `Factors` columns are all empty.

#3. Create a .csv file of this. Save it as HouseholdData.csv

New_Respondents <- c(1:10)
New_Sex <- c("Male", "Female", "Female", "Male", "Male", "Female", "Female", "Male", "Female", "Male")
New_Fathers_Occupation <- c(1,2,3,3,1,2,2,3,1,3)
New_Persons_At_Home <- c(5,7,3,8,6,4,4,2,11,6)
New_SiblingsAt_School <- c(2,3,0,5,2,3,1,2,6,2)
New_Types_Houses <- c("Wood", "Congrete", "Congrete", "Wood", "Semi-congrete", "Semi-congrete", "Wood", "Semi-congrete", "Semi-congrete", "Congrete")

Household_Data <- data.frame( Respondents=New_Respondents,Sex=New_Sex, FatherOccupation=New_Fathers_Occupation, Persons_At_Home=New_Persons_At_Home, Siblings_AtSchool=New_SiblingsAt_School, Types_Of_Houses=New_Types_Houses)
Household_Data

write.csv(Household_Data, file ="Household_Data.csv")

#a.Import the csv file into the R environment. Write the codes.

imported <- read.csv("Household_Data.csv")
imported


#b. Convert the Sex into factor using factor() function and change it into integer.[Legend: Male = 1 and Female = 2]. Write the R codes and its output.

imported$Sex <- factor(imported$Sex, levels = c("Male", "Female"))
imported$Sex<- as.integer(imported$Sex)
imported$Sex

#Output: 1 2 2 1 1 2 2 1 2 1

#c. Convert the Type of Houses into factor and change it into integer. [Legend: Wood = 1; Congrete = 2; Semi-Congrete = 3]. Write the R codes and its output.

imported$New_Types_Houses <- factor(imported$Types_Of_Houses, levels = c("Wood", "Congrete", "Semi-congrete"))
imported$Types_Of_Houses <- as.integer(imported$Types_Of_Houses)
imported$Types_Of_Houses

#Output:  1 2 2 1 3 3 1 3 3 2

#d.On fatherâ€™s occupation, factor it as Farmer = 1; Driver = 2; and Others = 3. What is the R code and its output?

imported$FatherOccupation <- factor(imported$FatherOccupation, levels = c(1,2,3), labels = c("Farmer", "Driver", "Others"))
imported$FatherOccupation

#Output:Farmer Driver Others Others Farmer Driver Driver Others Farmer Others 

# e. Select only all females respondent that has a father whose occupation is driver. Write the codes and its output.
imported
femaleDriver <- imported[imported$Sex == 2 & imported$FatherOccupation == "Driver" , c(3,4)]
femaleDriver



# f. Select the respondents that have greater than or equal to 5 number of siblings attending school. Write the codes and its output.
upper_five <- imported[imported$SiblingsAtSchool >= 5,]
upper_five 

 

#4.Interpret the graph.

#The graph shows the sentiment of tweets per day for the period of July 14, 2020 to July 21, 2020. 
#The sentiment is divided into three categories: negative, neutral, and positive. 
#On this day, July 14, the negative sentiment was the most prevalent among the other sentiments. This suggests that certain topics or events received negative feedback during that day. 
#On the following day, July 15, the negative sentiment remained at its peak, even as all the sentiments increased. This could indicate that something occurred that triggered negative sentiments on that day.
#Over the next few days, from July 17 to July 18, the negative sentiment remained consistently high, while both neutral and positive sentiments remained relatively stable.
#On the day, July 20, all sentiments reached their lowest point, even though there were still more negative sentiments among the others. This indicates that during that day, nothing significant happened.
#On this day, July 21, all sentiments increased, with the negative sentiment still being the most prominent. This could imply that something occurred that elicited negative responses from the public on that day.
#In conclusion, the graphs provide valuable insights into the sentiment analysis of tweets per day, allowing us to understand the public's perception and opinion on various topics.
